# Regression with Tabular California Housing Dataset

This repository contains a regression project using the Tabular California Housing dataset. The goal of the project is to build a regression model that can predict the median house value in California based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Tabular California Housing dataset. It consists of various features such as median income, average house occupancy, latitude, longitude, etc. The target variable is the median house value.

The dataset can be obtained from the following source:
[Tabular California Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e1/data)

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `train.csv`: This is the training data file.
- `test.csv`: This is the testing data file.
- `Regression with a Tabular California Housing Dataset.ipynb`: This is the Jupyter notebook used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: The main documentation file providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook


## Usage

To run the regression project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional): `python -m venv env`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate` (Unix) or `env\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
5. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train regression models, and evaluate their performance.
